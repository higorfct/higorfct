## 🚀 End-to-End & MLOps projects
Implementation of end-to-end machine learning pipelines, automation of deployment processes, and integration of DevOps practices for data science projects.  

**Key practices include:**  
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and monitoring.  
- **CI/CD for ML**: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration, automated testing (Pytest), and continuous deployment.  
- **Containerization**: Packaging ML applications with Docker for reproducibility and scalability.
