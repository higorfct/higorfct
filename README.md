# 🚀 End-to-End & MLOps Projects

Implementation of full machine learning pipelines, deployment automation, and integration of DevOps practices for scalable data systems.

**Key practices include:**  
- **MLOps Pipelines**: Data preprocessing, training, hyperparameter tuning, deployment and monitoring.  
- **CI/CD for ML**: GitHub Actions workflows, automated testing (Pytest), continuous deployment.  
- **Containerization**: Packaging ML applications with Docker for reproducibility and scalability.

**Projects:**  
- [MLOps Customer Churn Project](https://github.com/higorfct/MLOps-Customer-Churn-Project)  
- [Credit Risk Web Application](https://github.com/higorfct/Credit-Risk-Assessment-Project-)  
- [MLOps with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/higorfct/MLOps-with-Naive-Bayes)
